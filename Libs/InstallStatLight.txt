This toolwindow views the results of Silverlight unit tests from the Silverlight Toolkit.
Required steps:

1.) Install the Silverlight Toolkit, which will provide the new "Silverlight Unit Test" project type from http://silverlight.codeplex.com/

2.) To be able to use this toolwindow, you have to download "StatLight" from http://statlight.codeplex.com/.

3.) Then extract the content to:

Local App Data Directory (e.g. "C:\Users\JohnDoe\AppData\Local\StatLight")

StatLight will be used to execute the unit tests.
Planned improvements:

Complete silent mode (dependant on commandline support via StatLight and Silverlight Toolkit project output as non-xap)

Run tests on build-finished-option

Tag-filter for tests to run

Performance improvements
